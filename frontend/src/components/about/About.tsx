        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary">
          **StockSight is not just another finance tool**â€”it is developed by
          **biotech insiders who understand the key investment signals**.
          Existing tools are built by **general finance/tech professionals**
          without deep biotech expertise. They focus on **broad market
          indicators**, missing the **specific clinical, regulatory, and R&D
          insights** crucial for biotech investments. StockSight **integrates
          biotech-first intelligence**â€”aligning **FDA filings, clinical trial
          results, and market trends** in one unified platform.
        </Typography>
