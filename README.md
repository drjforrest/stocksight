### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stocksight.git
cd stocksight

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

1. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MarketStack API key and database credentials
```

2. Initialize the database:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Running the Application

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

## üìö API Documentation

Once running, access the interactive API documentation:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## üîß Technical Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.12+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization
- **APIs**: MarketStack integration
- **Analysis**: 
  - pandas for data manipulation
  - scikit-learn for ML predictions
  - statsmodels for time series analysis

## üíæ Caching System

### Redis Configuration

StockSight uses Redis for high-performance caching with both synchronous and asynchronous clients. Configure Redis through environment variables:

```bash
REDIS_HOST=localhost      # Redis server host
REDIS_PORT=6379          # Redis server port
REDIS_DB=0              # Redis database number
REDIS_PASSWORD=         # Optional Redis password
```

### Cache Implementation

The caching system provides two implementations:

1. **Synchronous Cache** (`RedisCache`):
   - General-purpose caching for API responses and computed data
   - Automatic JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Configurable TTL (Time-To-Live) for cache entries
   - Built-in error handling and logging

```python
from services.cache import RedisCache, cache_result

# Direct cache usage
cache = RedisCache()
cache.set("my_key", {"data": "value"}, expire=3600)
data = cache.get("my_key")

# Decorator usage
@cache_result(prefix="market", expire=300)
async def get_market_data():
    # ... fetch market data ...
```

2. **Asynchronous Cache** (MarketStack Client):
   - Specialized for MarketStack API responses
   - Rate limiting and automatic retries
   - Async/await support
   - Request deduplication

### Cache Keys and Expiration

Predefined cache prefixes and TTLs for different data types:

- Market Data: 5 minutes TTL
- SEC Data: 24 hours TTL
- FDA Data: 24 hours TTL
- Search Results: 1 hour TTL

### Best Practices

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Use the `_generate_key()` method for consistent key creation
   - Include relevant parameters in cache keys
   - Avoid overly long or complex keys

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Cache failures are logged but don't break the application
   - Fallback to direct API calls when cache is unavailable
   - Automatic retry mechanism for failed cache operations

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use appropriate TTLs based on data volatility
   - Implement batch operations where possible
   - Monitor cache hit/miss ratios

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Set reasonable expiration times
   - Use compression for large values
   - Implement cache eviction policies
